### Java Program: Employee Management System
This is a Java program for managing employee records. It allows you to add, edit, and delete employee records, as well as view a list of all employees in the system. The program uses object-oriented programming principles to organize the data and operations related to employee records.

## Basic Concepts of Java
Java is a popular programming language that is widely used for developing applications for a variety of platforms. It was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems and has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation.

Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it organizes data and operations into classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class that contains data and methods (operations) that define its behavior.

Java also has a strong type system, which means that every variable and expression has a specific data type. Some common data types in Java include:

int: used to store integer values
double: used to store floating-point values
boolean: used to store boolean values (true or false)
String: used to store text
char: used to store a single character
Java also has several control structures that are used to control the flow of a program, including

if statements: used to conditionally execute code
for loops: used to execute code a certain number of times
while loops: used to execute code while a condition is true
switch statements: used to execute code based on the value of a variable
These are just a few of the basic concepts of Java. If you're interested in learning more about Java programming, there are many resources available online, including tutorials, videos, and documentation.

## How to Use the Program
To use this program, simply download the source code from this repository and compile it using a Java compiler. Then, run the program from the command line or an IDE.

When you run the program, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to add, edit, or delete employee records, as well as view a list of all employees in the system. Follow the prompts to enter the necessary information for each operation.

## Conclusion
Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for developing applications for a variety of platforms. This program is a simple example of how Java can be used to manage data and operations related to employee records. With a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Java, you can create more complex and sophisticated applications that meet your specific needs.
